# Project Protest

### Overview
Our project is an social justice web application, that helps the user find nearby marked protests in your local area. Such as if there is a climate change protest happening downtown, it will mark where the location is. Our purpose is to help guide people to social justice movements, and raise their voices.

### Setup
Many people use social medias to help gain traction and announce about a social justice movement happening around their area. But majority of the time most users swipe or don't even look at those posts because of short attention spans. This web application is designed to mark nearby protests and provide directions toward those locations to make it easier for people to find where those protests are. We focused on the theme **Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions**, but other goals that helped contribute to the main theme were the themes **Reduced Inequalities** and **Quality Education**. This is because social justice movements are our bread and butter when it comes to social changes that we don't agree with.
